# Automating my job search

I've been bombarded with news about the recession a a little more than I would like recently. It seems like every day, more and more high skill professionals are experiencing layoffs across the skill spectrum. I love programming, because it seems to be one of the few places in which you can really change your life outcomes based on how much you devote to learning a skill. I suppose my initial hypothesis was that programming looked like:

    def calculateChanceIHaveAJob(skill):
        if skill == 10:
            return 99
        elif skill > 5:
            return 50
        elif skill < 5:
            return 5

However, it might have looked more like

    
    def calculateChanceIHaveAJob(skill, numberOfCompaniesWithNewHiringBudget, randomNum,)
