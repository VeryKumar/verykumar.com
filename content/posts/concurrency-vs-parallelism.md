# Concurrency vs Parallelism: Overlap is not simultaneous!

To me, it boils down to changing focus, vs true multitasking. The former, is much more similar to the human mind. The latter, is probably like the unconscious mind. I say probably, because studying the unconscious is one of the noisiest asks you could possibly have. I say noisy and not biased on purpose: studying the unconscious is a topic that has answers all over the place, not in one place that is incorrect.

Here is a quote:

"one is a about structure: concurrency, the other is about execution: parallelism."

Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.

The way we express the problem is concurrency.

We can think of something as parallel, or the concurrent composition of two procedures.
